# 100DaysOfCode Challenge - 3rd Round log

This is the first round I'll try and keep a daily log here on Github, as well as tweeting my progress on my [twitter page](https://twitter.com/ValeriaRagonese).

**Project: Pomodoro Clock in React**


Started the FreeCodeCamp project on building a Pomodoro Clock. I have created the frontend and I wanted to experiment with CSS, so it won't be mobile-friendly. I started working on the timer but got stuck. The timer has always been my problem. I need to find a library that will help me implementing this.

**Project: Timer for Pomodoro Clock**

I haven't found a working solution for the timer. I have tried different codes found online, but some run too fast or it was getting too complicated to stop once the stop button has being pressed.
I will probably take a break tomorrow and working on something else.
