**Project: Pomodoro Clock in React


Started the FreeCodeCamp project on building a Pomodoro Clock. I have created the frontend and I wanted to experiment with CSS, so it won't be mobile-friendly. I started working on the timer but got stuck. The timer has always been my problem. I need to find a library that will help me implementing this.
